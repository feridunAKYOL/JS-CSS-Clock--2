# JS-CSS-Clock--2

A clock built with only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This project uses HTML and CSS to build the frame of clock. JavaScript sets the real time and moves the hands of hour-minutes and seconds.

Try the live demo [right here](https://ayseakyol.github.io/JS-CSS-Clock--2/), it looks something like this:

## Notes

Studying this project we learned about:

* Using `transform` and `transition` tags
* How the `Date` method start the time.
* How the rotate the hands with the help of style transform.
* How milestones, labels & issues can help organize work ->
  * user stories === milestones
  * tasks === issues
  * labels === what type of task it is

We struggled with:

* How to create the development strategy. 
* We could not change the length of the hands. When we change the length of them, the origin is also changed.
* Keeping track of all the branches and forks. 

These resources were very helpful:

* [Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions)
* [Transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)
* [GitHub Project Management](https://github.com/features/project-management)
